# Official SpawnCamp Sandbox 🚧📻
A pre-configured Unity project with code, tools, and materials included. With, basically empty, test scenes designed to be a fun and easy starting point for learning and prototyping within the engine.
> beta 0.1.0

## Project Files 💽

🍦 **Comes in Two(2) Flavors:**
- Standard 3D* Version (Built in Renderer)
- URP 3D* Version (Universal Render Pipeline)

## Scenes 💾
- **Sandbox**  
  A visually welcoming test scene with extra tools and effects to start prototyping like a pro.
- **SandboxLite****  
  A bare-bones test scene with only lights, a camera, and a floor. Giving you plenty of space to prototype.

## Project Dependencies 📁
Our project aims to be small and simple but Third-Party (Unity Asset Store) assets *are* supplemented to provide basic tools and a bit of wow-factor.  
**Note** that none of the Third-Party assets are required to use this project (ie. the SandboxLite scene).  
However, if you wish, I made sure to only chose **Free** assets.
